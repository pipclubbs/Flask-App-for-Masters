    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Pip. I'm from north east England, and have a passion for sport. In
      particular, rowing, ultrarunning, aerial and weight lifting. But when I'm
      not doing those (or creating web apps for my Computer Science Masters
      course) I can usually be found at a climbing wall or on a big hill or rock
      somewhere. <br />
      After over twenty years working in project management for academic and
      educational publishing I decided to get back to education myself, taking a
      big leap into the unknown, and doing a Masters in Computer Science - a
      huge change for me! In July 2023 I started my first software development
      job as a Junior Software Developer with Proctor & Gamble, and I am very
      much enjoying the challenge so far.

    <h3>About this web app</h3>
    For my Masters Research Project I decided to experiment with web scraping.
    Fed up with the difficulty of locating climbing information I
    <em>knew</em> was online somewhere but couldn't find it, I decided to
    investigate why the search engines like Google and Bing are not so great at
    finding information on niche topics, and to see if building a targeted,
    climbing-specific search engine using web scrapers was possible. This web
    application is the result of that experiment.<br />
    As it stands, it is a protytpe, proof of concept to see if the idea is
    feasible and to assess what I learn from putting it together.
